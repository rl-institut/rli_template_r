# rli\_template\_r

A template for new data analysis projects written in R at the RLI.

You can use this template to prepare a new Github repository for collaborative data analysis projects using the R statistical programming language. This is an opinionated template and suggests a folder structure as well as data management processes to make collaboration smoother within and outside the RLI.

Simply click on the green `Use this template` button on the left of the `Clone or download` button.

The detailed instructions to create a new repository from this template can be found [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-repository-from-a-template).

Once you have created the new repository, you can remove everything before and including this line.
